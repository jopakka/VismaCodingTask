# VismaCodingTask
Kotlin console application made for Visma Solutions to their coding task.

## Description
I understood the problem that user send an action with parameters and I needed to make an class which checks that scheme and action are correct. Also it checks that necessary parameters are valid.

Only problems that I had was that I wasn't sure what action class should return like is it another class or function or what. So I just decided that it will return class.

For future improvements I think that error checks could be handled better like now it just throws an error, but maybe it should return something else.

Otherwise I think that this small task was really nice to do.
